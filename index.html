            <h2>Early History</h2>
            <hr />
            <p class="content">
              The early history of Ethiopia is marked by the rise of the Kingdom
              of Aksum, one of the great civilizations of the ancient world.
              <br /><br />
              Flourishing between the 1st and 7th centuries AD, Aksum was a
              major trading empire known for its impressive architecture,
              including the famous obelisks. <br /><br />

              It was during this period that Christianity was introduced to
              Ethiopia, becoming a cornerstone of Ethiopian culture and
              identity. <br /><br />
              The kingdom's strategic location allowed it to dominate trade
              routes between Africa, Arabia, and Asia, making it a powerful and
              influential state in the ancient world.

            <hr />
            <p class="content">
              In the modern era, Ethiopia has undergone significant political,
              social, and economic transformations. The country successfully
              resisted colonization, maintaining its independence during the
              European scramble for Africa, which culminated in the historic
              Battle of Adwa in 1896. <br /><br />
              The 20th century saw the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie, whose
              leadership brought about modernization efforts and international
              prominence. <br /><br />

              However, Ethiopia also faced challenges, including periods of
              political instability, droughts, and famines.
